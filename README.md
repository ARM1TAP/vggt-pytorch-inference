## Introduction

The VGGT model is a well-known architecture in the field of computer vision. It has proven effective in various tasks, including image classification and object detection. By using PyTorch, this repository provides a flexible and efficient way to run the VGGT model for inference.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARM1TAP/vggt-pytorch-inference.git
cd vggt-pytorch-inference
```

Next, install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have PyTorch installed. You can find the installation instructions on the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

## Usage

After installation, you can run the VGGT model for inference. You will need to download the model weights. You can find the latest weights in the [Releases section](https://github.com/ARM1TAP/vggt-pytorch-inference/releases).

Once you have the weights, you can run the inference script:

```bash
python inference.py --image <path_to_image> --model <path_to_model_weights>
```

Replace `<path_to_image>` with the path to your input image and `<path_to_model_weights>` with the path to the downloaded model weights.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example to demonstrate how to run the VGGT model:

1. Download the model weights from the [Releases section](https://github.com/ARM1TAP/vggt-pytorch-inference/releases).
2. Prepare an image for inference. You can use any image file, but make sure it is in a compatible format (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python inference.py --image example.jpg --model vggt_weights.pth
```

The output will display the predictions made by the model. You can modify the script to suit your needs, such as saving the output or visualizing the results.
